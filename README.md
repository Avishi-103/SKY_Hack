## United Airlines Call Center Optimization Project

### Problem Statements
**Question 1: Analysis of Call Duration Metrics (AHT and AST)**

- Long Average Handle Time (AHT) impacts efficiency and customer satisfaction. This analysis explores various factors contributing to extended call durations, including agent performance, call types, sentiment, and call volume during high and low periods.
- The key drivers of long AHT and Average Speed to Answer (AST) are identified, particularly during high-volume periods. The analysis includes quantifying the percentage difference between the average handling time for the most frequent and least frequent call reasons.

**Question 2: Improving Self-Service Options in the IVR System**
- A recurring issue is the escalation of self-solvable problems to agents, increasing their workload. The analysis identifies specific call reasons and patterns in transcripts to determine granular issues that can be resolved via improved self-service options in the IVR system.
- Recommendations are proposed for enhancing the IVR options, providing a rationale based on the data-driven analysis to reduce unnecessary agent intervention.


**Question 3: Categorizing and Understanding Primary Call Reasons**

- Accurately categorizing call reasons is essential for enhancing operational efficiency and directing customers to appropriate resources. This part of the project involves analyzing the dataset to identify patterns and categorize primary call reasons.
- The approach includes detailing data analysis techniques and feature identification methods to improve process streamlining, reduce manual tagging, and optimize customer service efficiency.
